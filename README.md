# Chat App

I wanted to create a chat app, in that nature, it needed to send and receive data in real-time. I used react context API to pass data around the app and Firebase to authenticate users and store messages, users, and channel information. It was a great challenge and I'm very pleased with the current state, I will continue to update and add features down the road.
